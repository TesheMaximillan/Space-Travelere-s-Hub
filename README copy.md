# Bookstore App

> In this website, I creatde an MVP version of Bookstore App that allows:

    * Display a list of books.
    * Add a book.
    * Remove a selected book.:

## In this project I followed the following requirements

### Phase 1

* Reusable components are created.
* React router are added and setted two `<Route>` and `<Link>` for the app navigation
* Books page is crated and setted as the default view
* BookLists are displayed in the book page
* a book component is created for displaying single book
* A form for adding book is created
* a category page is craeted with a button "Check status" only

### Phase 2

* redux library and react-redux libraries are used.
* Used a feature folder to structure the project.
* Book actions and reducers are written using `ducks pattern`
* categories actions and reducers written using `ducks pattern`
* Redux stores are configured

### Phase 3

* Made states are immutable.
* Initial state is changed by default value.
* Redux provider is imported to the main component (`index.js`)
* App is connected to Redux store
* List of books are displayed in redux store
* Books are added by using `useDispatch` method
* Books are removed by using `useDispatch` method
* Checkstatus functionality is when cattegory button is clicked

### Phase 4

* redux-tunk is added to my project as a middleware.
* I used axios for making API calls.
* Redux provider is imported to the main component (`index.js`)
* book lists are loaded from api when the page is reloaded
* addBook and removeBook features are modified to work with the API

### Phase 5

* I styled the website according to Zeplin's design
* I created common modules like `Card` and `Button` for reusability
* I applied component level styling using `scss`, and imported all of the components into `App.scss` file 
* I applied `useEffect` and `useState` hooks for the circular progress bar and used a random number for the percentage
* App deployed to Heroku
