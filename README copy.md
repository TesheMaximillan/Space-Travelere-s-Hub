# Bookstore App

> In this project we are worked with the real live data from the SpaceX API. And in this project we build a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application will allow users to book rockets and join selected space missions.:

- The Space Travelers' Hub consists of Rockets, Missions, and the My Profile section.
- The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking.
- The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status. There is also a button next to each mission that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier.
- The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.
- APIs > [Rockets](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets) | [Missions](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/missions)
## In this project we followed the following requirements

* Actions are dispatched once and do not add data to store on every re-render
* Rockets data are fetched when the application starts
The mission data fetched data when use navigates to the mission actions

## Technologies

- React
- Redux
- SCSS
